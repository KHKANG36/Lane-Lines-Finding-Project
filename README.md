\# **Overview**

When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go.  The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle.  Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm. In this project I detect lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV.  OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images.

### 1. My lane line detection pipeline
In my pipeline, I converted the images to grayscale initially. Then, I smoothed the converted image to reduce unnecessary noise. After that, I acquired x,y coordinates of image edges by applying "Canny edge detection" algorithm. To apply better region of interests, I analyzed the location of lane-lines for all the images/videos and found optimal 4 vertices based on the height and width information of the images. 4 optimized vertices were (50,height), (width/2-45, height/2+50), (width/2+45,height/2+50), (width-50, height). The region of interest was almost well fitted with all 6 images and 2 videos. In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function followed by below steps. 1) I separated left and right lane-lines based on the slope of edge-detected lines. If slope > 0, we can guess it right lane. Otherwise, if slope < 0, we can guess it left lane. However, if the value of slope is too small, it might not be a lane-line and might be wrong-detected information. Therefore, I used "0.3" value for lane judgement to increase the correctness. 2) I set Y_max height of the image and found Y_min by comparing all y values. 3) I calculated average slope and average y-intercept of left and right lane each. 4) Based on all information (average slope, y_min, y_max and average y-intercept), I was able to find the x_min, x_max value as well. 5) I Drawed the straight-line with x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max

### 2. Potential shortcomings of my lane line detection pipeline and future opportunity for improvement
First potential shortcoming would be the accuracy of the region of interets. Location of the lane could be different with vehicle location or road environment/curve. So, it is inevitable that there should be an error of region of interests even though the location of fixed camera is almost same. We should come up with algorithms which can adopt the region of interest to different image/video intelligently. 2) Another shortcoming could be the accuracy of average slope and average y-intercept. Averaging would not be optimal solution to estimate the optimal slope and y-intercept. So, I tried to optimize the values by using "GradientDecentOptimizer" with tensorflow library. Even though it does not work well because of insufficient knowledge about it, eventually learning based regression algorithm would be useful for this project. 3) The parameter selection for Canny & Hough algorithm was not perfect. I tried this algorithm by changing the parameters a lot of time. But, I could not find optimal value for every image/video yet. I would have to come up with optimal parameter selection methodology. 4) When it comes to last "challenge" video, my pipeline didn't work well. The drawed line was not stable because of the sharply curved lane iamges in video clip. In addition, I could not resolve the value error "cannot convert float NaN to integer" yet. I will try to resolve this problems before next project.
